- Change the map in the directory tree to be keyed on boost::path rather
than a string. Every time a boost::path is passed in it is converted to
a string which is ineffecient.

- In the directory tree, each node contains it's full path. This is not
memory effecient. It would be more effecient to have each node only
contain it's directory name and then create the full path by iterating
over all of the node's ancestors.
