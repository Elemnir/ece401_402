    As team lead, it was my responsibility to see that everyone on the team knew what they needed to do, and when they needed to do it. I was responsible for scheduling meetings, being our spokesperson with Dr. Birdwell, and communicating with the customer. I was also responsible for ensuring that deliverables were submitted on time, and coordinating my team membersâ€™ skills and knowledge to ensure that they were best utilized. 
	As one of the primary researchers, and the only member of the team really comfortable with circuit design, it was also my responsibility to research devices and solutions that would work for our particular application. This included researching parts and trying to ensure that every part picked fit within the stringent weight limits of the design problem. As a part of this role, I was responsible for a significant portion of the requirements document and the final device design.
