  \noindent{\textbf{\underline{\Large Need Assessment}:}} \\

  \vspace{16 pt}

  There is a need for a way to easily locate a frisbee golf disc. Frisbee golf
  courses are often contructed in locations with many natural obstacles, such
  as in forests. Even though the obstructions make the game more challenging,
  they also provide many hiding places for poorly thrown discs. A disc could be
  in a tree or hidden under leaves, making the search for the disc tedious and
  time consuming. Even if one knows the general location of a disc, the leaves
  and trees greatly increase the search time required to recover it.
  Consequently, a lot of time can be wasted searching for frisbee discs, rather
  than playing the sport. It is also possible for a search to be unsuccessful,
  resulting in the loss of a disc. Taking into consideration the multitude of
  possible hiding places for a disc, there is a need not only to know the 
  general location of a disc, but also able to pinpoint it when in its vicinity.
  Disc golf can be played in all weather conditions, so the mechanism used to
  track the disc needs to be able to operate in different temperatures, as well
  as be water-resistant. Considering the importance of a disc's weight and
  dimensions, the tracking apparatus needs to be lightweight and produce minimal
  interference with the aerodynamics of the disc. The problem of losing discs
  most often affects the beginner or intermediate disc golf player. With the
  recent boom in the popularity of disc golf, there is now an abundance of
  inexperienced players, all of whom would benefit from an easy way to locate
  discs.
